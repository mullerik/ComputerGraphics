Implementation notes:

* We implemented the lighting bonus.
* We chose to calculate the spline points at pre-processing time, instead of calculating each point
    as the animation runs - this saves computing time(less calculations). This is a classing cpu-memory trade-off
    and we chose to save computing power, since we have enough memory.
* We added 2 more tracks to "TrackPoints" class.
* We draw the rail using triangles due to openGL's nature of expecting triangles (and not polygons) when using textures.


Thank you!
